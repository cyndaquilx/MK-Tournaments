# Mario Kart Tournament Bot

This is a Discord bot written in discord.py designed to help you run large-scale Free-for-all or Mogi tournaments for Mario Kart games. The bot is designed to automate all of the long and tedious tasks associated with running tournaments, including:
- Randomizing rooms using random.org, and printing them in a customizable format
- Storing results for each room of the tournament
- Determining which players will advance to the next round, including support for more complicated rules such as tiebreakers, highest scoring xth place teams, and more
- Generating final placements
